# What's New?

{{ page.description }}

## Overview

The following document describes what has been added, what has changed, and how to deal with these changes in the RhinoCommon SDK. A lot of effort has been put into keeping the RhinoCommon SDK in Rhino 6 as compatible with the Rhino 5 version as possible, but in a small number of cases this was impossible. One goal of this document is to describe these breaking changes and what to do about them.
