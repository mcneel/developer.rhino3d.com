## Compute can:
  * Calculate Grasshopper definitions online in a serial or parallel solutions.
  * Manipulate Rhino (3DM) and other file types anywhere on the net.
  * Call to over 2400+ geometric operations on custom objects from within existing processes online. Including points, curves, surfaces, meshes and solids.

## Compute Features
  * Do geometry calculations through a cloud based stateless REST API.
  * Access [2400+ RhinoCommon API calls](https://compute.rhino3d.com/sdk) from outside Rhino.
  * Access to additional RhinoCommon functions not available in [openNURBS](https://www.rhino3d.com/opennurbs), including:
  * Closest point calculations
  * Intersection calculations
  * Surface tessellation (meshing)
  * Interpolation
  * Booleans
  * Area and mass property calculations
  * Other miscellaneous geometry calculations
  * Extendable REST method calls through a common declaration.
  * Access existing Rhino/Grasshopper plugins through the online interface.
  * Serialize operations in one request through grasshopper or python scripts.
  * Client side libraries available for use with standalone C#(.NET), Python and JavaScript.

## Open Source:
Based on [Rhino Inside™ technology](https://www.rhino3d.com/inside), compute is an [open source project](https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d).
