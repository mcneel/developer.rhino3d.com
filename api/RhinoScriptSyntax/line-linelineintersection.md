Calculates the intersection of two non-parallel lines. Note, the two
        lines do not have to intersect for an intersection to be found. (see help)
        

### Parameters:

lineA, lineB = lines to intersect
        

### Returns:


a tuple containing a point on the first line and a point on the second line if successful
None on error
