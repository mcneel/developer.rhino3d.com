import scriptcontext


stickyval = 0
# restore stickyval if it has been saved
if scriptcontext.sticky.has_key("my_key"):
    stickyval = scriptcontext.sticky["my_key"]

print "sticky =", stickyval
print "nonsticky =", nonstickyval

```

The `scriptcontext` module contains a standard python dictionary called sticky which "sticks" around during the running of Rhino.  This dictionary can be used to save settings between execution of your scripts and then get at those saved settings the next time you run your script or from a completely different script.
