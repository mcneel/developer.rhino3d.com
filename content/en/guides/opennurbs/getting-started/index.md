## Prerequisites

openNURBS is intended for *skilled* C++ developers. Please read [What is openNURBS?](/guides/opennurbs/what-is-opennurbs) if you have not already. It is also presumed that you have an application that wishes to access *3DM* files outside of Rhinoceros.

## openNURBS public SDK

To download the public C++ SDK and example 3DM files, visit https://www.rhino3d.com/opennurbs.

## Supported C++ Compilers

The openNURBS C++ toolkit has been successfully used with the following compilers:

- A version of *Microsoft Visual Studio* that includes the Visual Studio 2019 (v142) platform toolset. Thus, you can use either Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio 2019. To build openNURBS and the examples with *Microsoft Visual Studio*, use the solution *opennurbs_public.sln*.

  To use C++ opennurbs in your Visual Studio project:

  1. Open opennurbs_public.sln in Visual Studio, select the platform and configuration, and rebuild all.
  1. In your project's stdafx.h, put the following lines. This will include all the header files you need to call C++ opennurbs and automatically link in the correct libraries:

  ```cpp
  // defining OPENNURBS_PUBLIC_INSTALL_DIR enables automatic linking using pragmas
  #define OPENNURBS_PUBLIC_INSTALL_DIR "<MY_INSTALLPATH>"
  // uncomment the next line if you want to use opennurbs as a DLL
  //#define OPENNURBS_IMPORTS
  #include "<MY_INSTALLPATH>/opennurbs_public.h"
  ```

- *Apple Xcode 9.2* (9C40b): To build openNURBS and the examples with *Xcode 9.2* (or later), use the workspace *opennurbs_public.xcworkspace*.
- *Other C++ compilers* The compiler must support the C++14 standard. A *makefile* is provided as a starting point. The openNURBS C++ source code is clean and simple. If you are using a C++ compiler that supports the C++14 standard and run into some toolkit code that causes problems, please [let us know](http://discourse.mcneel.com/category/opennurbs).  We'll attempt to change the code to accommodate the compiler.

## Read and Write

Use `ONX_Model::Read()` and `ONX_Model::Write()` to add support for reading and writing 3DM files to your application. See *example_read.cpp* and *example_write.cpp* for more details. 

1. Compile the openNURBS Toolkit library.  To compile the example programs you must link with the openNURBS Toolkit library.
1. Study *example_read\example_read.cpp*. All the openNURBS geometry classes are derived from the `ON_Geometry` class.  If you need generic attribute information, there is probably an `ON_Geometry` member function that will answer your query.  See the `Dump()` function in *example_read.cpp* for code that demonstrates how to use the `Cast()` function to get at the actual class definitions.
1. Study *example_write\example_write.cpp*.  If you want to write points, meshes, NURBS curves, NURBS surfaces, or trimmed NURBS surfaces, you should be able to cut and paste most of what you need from the functions in *example_write.cpp*.  If you want to write trimmed surfaces or b-reps, then please study *example_brep.cpp*.
1. Study *example_brep\example_brep.cpp*.  If you want to write solid models or more general b-reps, then first work through *example_write.cpp* and then work through *example_brep.cpp*.
1. The comments in the openNURBS Toolkit header files are the primary source of documentation.  I suggest that you use a development environment that has high quality tags capabilities and a good class browser.
1. In the code you write include only *opennurbs.h*. The *opennurbs.h* header file includes the necessary openNURBS toolkit header files in the appropriate order.
1. Other items to note:
     1. *Strings* The `ON_wString` class has `wchar_t` elements. When using Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows, `sizeof(wchar_t)=2` and `ON_wString` content is UTF-16 encoded. When using Apple XCode on Mac OS, `sizeof(wchar_t)=4` and `ON_wString` content is UTF-32 encoded.
     1. All memory allocations and frees are done through `onmalloc()`, `onfree()`, and `onrealloc()`.  The source that ships with openNURBS has `onmalloc()` call `malloc()` and `onfree()` call `free()`.
     1. If you want to use Open GL to render openNURBS geometry, you may want to include *opennurbs_gl.h* after *opennurbs.h* and add *opennurbs_gl.cpp* to your openNURBS library.  See *example_gl.cpp* for details.
     1. The openNURBS Toolkit works correctly on both big and little endian CPUs.

## Examples

This is an overview of the examples included with the openNURBS toolkit:

- *example_read\example_read.cpp*: Create a program by compiling *example_read.cpp* and statically linking with the openNURBS library.  The code in *example_read.cpp* illustrates how to read an openNURBS *.3dm* file.
- *example_write\example_write.cpp*: Create a program by compiling *example_write.cpp* and linking with the openNURBS library.  The code in *example_write.cpp* illustrates how to write layers, units system and tolerances, viewports, spotlights, points, meshes, NURBs curves, NURBs surfaces, trimmed NURBs surfaces, texture and bump map information, render material name, and material definitions to an openNURBS *.3dm* file. The bitmap *example_write\example_texture.bmp* is referenced by a rendering material texture in one of the 3DM files created by *example_write*.
- *example_test\example_test.cpp*: Create a program by compiling *example_test.cpp* and linking with the openNURBS library. The example_test program can be used to validate your opennurbs installation.
- *example_brep\example_brep.cpp*: Create a program by compiling *example_brep.cpp* and linking with the openNURBS library.  The code in *example_write.cpp* illustrates how to write a solid model.
- *example_userdata\example_userdata.cpp*: Create a program by compiling *example_userdata.cpp* and linking with the openNURBS library.  The code in *example_userdata* demonstrates how to create and manage arbitrary user defined information in *.3dm* files.
- *The Open GL example*: This code is a crude sketch of a starting point for using OpenGL to display opennurbs geometry. Start with simple mesh objects and work up. We do not provide support for using OpenGL.

## Answers to frequently asked questions:

### ON_Mesh

#### Vertex ordering in ON_Mesh faces

All faces in a `ON_Mesh` are stored with vertices listed in counter-clockwise order.  In particular, for quads the vertices are ordered as:

![Vertex Ordering](/images/opennurbs-getting-started-01.png)

The quads may be non-planar.

The definition of `void ON_GL( const ON_Mesh& )` in *opennurbs_gl.cpp* demonstrates how to go through an `ON_Mesh` and render all the quads as two triangles.

### ON_Brep

#### Orientation of ON_Brep faces

The UV orientation of surfaces in a Brep is arbitrary.  If the `BOOL ON_BrepFace::m_bRev` member is `FALSE`, then the face's orientation agrees with the surface's natural {{< mathjax >}}$$Du \times Dv$${{< /mathjax >}} orientation.  When the member is `TRUE`, the face's orientation is opposite the surface's natural {{< mathjax >}}$$Du \times Dv$${{< /mathjax >}} orientation.

If your application cannot handle `ON_BrepFaces` that have a `TRUE` `m_bRev` flag, then call `ON_Brep::FlipReversedSurfaces()`.  See the comments in `ON_Brep::FlipReversedSurfaces()` and `ON_Brep::SwapFaceParameters()` for details.

#### Trimming loop order and nesting

The `ON_BrepLoop::m_type` member records the type of boundary (inner, outer, etc.).  A `ON_BrepFace` has exactly one outer loop and it is the first loop referenced in the `ON_BrepFace::m_li[]` array.  The inner loops all define "holes" in the `ON_BrepFace`.  All the inner holes lie inside of the outer loop.  A `ON_BrepFace` is always path connected.  In particular, inner loops are not "nested."

#### Surfaces in Rhino are read as ON_Breps

Internally, Rhino stores all surfaces as some type of b-rep and the openNURBS toolkit reads these objects as b-reps. To see if an entire

`ON_Brep` is really just a surface, use:

`BOOL ON_Brep::IsSurface()`

If `ON_Brep::IsSurface()` returns `TRUE`, then the b-rep geometry is the same as the surface `ON_Brep::m_S[0]`.

To see of a particular face in a b-rep is really just a surface, use:

`BOOL ON_Brep::FaceIsSurface( face_index )`

If `ON_Brep::FaceIsSurface( face_index )` returns `TRUE`, then the face's geometry is the same as the surface `ON_Brep::m_S[face.m_si]`.
