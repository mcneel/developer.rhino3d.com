## Problem

In Rhino, you can insert an instance of a block and give it a non-uniform scale (transformation).  But, when you read the model, using the openNURBS toolkit, and try to explode the block into its geometric form, the geometry is no longer non-uniformly scaled.

## Solution

Not all `ON_Geometry`-derived classes can be accurately modified with transformations like projections, shears, and non-uniform scaling. For example, if you were to apply a non-uniform scale to a circle, which is represented by an `ON_ArcCurve` curve, the resulting geometry is no longer a circle.

When exploding an instance reference into its geometric form, first test to see if the instance reference's transformation is a similarity transformation.  This can be done by using `ON_XForm::IsSimilarity()`.  See *opennurbs_xform.h* for more information.

If the transformation is not a similarity, then convert the geometry into a form that can be accurately modified.  This can be done by using the `ON_Geometry::MakeDeformable()` override on the geometric object...

```cpp
if (bNeedXform)
{
 // If not a similarity transformation, make sure geometry
 // can be deformed. Generally, this involves convert non-NURBS
 // geometry into NURBS geometry.
 if (0 == xform.IsSimilarity() )
   geometry->MakeDeformable();

 // Do the transformation
 geometry->Transform(xform);
}
```
