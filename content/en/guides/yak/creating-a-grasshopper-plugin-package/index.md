The [Package Manager](../yak/) was introduced in Rhino 7. It makes it easier to discover, install and manage Grasshopper plug-ins from within Rhino. This guide will describe how to create a package from a Grasshopper plug-in that can be published to the package server.

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
The package manager is cross-platform. The examples below are for Windows.
For Mac, replace the path to the Yak CLI tool with <code>"/Applications/Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}.app/Contents/Resources/bin/yak"</code>.
{{< /call-out >}}



First, let's assume you have a folder on your computer which contains all the files that you would like to distribute in your package. Something like this...

```commandline
C:\Users\Bozo\dist
â”œâ”€â”€ Marmoset.gha
â”œâ”€â”€ icon.png
â””â”€â”€ misc\
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ LICENSE.txt
```

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
This is just an example. The only files that matter are Marmoset.gha and icon.png (we'll reference the icon in the manifest.yml file later).
{{< /call-out >}}

We're going to use the Yak CLI tool to create the package, so open up a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory above.

```commandline
> cd C:\Users\Bozo\dist
```

Now, we need a `manifest.yml` file! You can easily create your own by studying the [Manifest Reference Guide](../the-package-manifest). Alternatively, you can use the `spec` command to generate a skeleton file. We'll do the latter here.

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}\System\Yak.exe" spec

Inspecting content: Marmoset.gha

name: marmoset
version: 1.0.0

description: >
  This plug-in does something. I'm not really sure exactly what it's supposed to
  do, but it does it better than any other plug-in.
url: https://example.com


Saved to C:\Users\Bozo\dist\manifest.yml
```

The `spec` command takes a look at the current directory and, if present, will glean useful information from the `.gha` assembly and use it generate a `manifest.yml` with name, version, authors, etc. pre-populated. If you haven't added this information, then placeholders will be used.

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
The `spec` command is useful for generating the manifest.yml file initially. Once you have one, keep it with your project and update it for each release.
{{< /call-out >}}

Open the manifest file with your [favourite editor](https://code.visualstudio.com) and fill in the gaps.

Afterwards, you should have something that looks a little like this...

```yaml
---
name: marmoset
version: 1.0.0
authors:
- Park Ranger
description: >
  This plug-in does something. I'm not really sure exactly what it's supposed to
  do, but it does it better than any other plug-in.
url: https://example.com
icon: icon.png
keywords:
- mammal
```

Now that we have a manifest file, we can build the package!

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}\System\Yak.exe" build

```

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
The filename includes a <a href="../the-anatomy-of-a-package#distributions" class="alert-link">"distribution tag"</a> (in this case <code>rh6_18-any</code>). The first part, <code>rh6_18</code>, is inferred from the version of Grasshopper.dll or Rhinocommon.dll that is referenced in the plug-in project. The second part, <code>any</code>, refers to the platform that the plug-in is intended for. To build a platform-specfic package, run the <code>build</code> command again with the <code>&#45;&#45;platform &lt;platform&gt;</code> argument, where <code>&lt;platform&gt;</code> can be either <code>win</code> or <code>mac</code>.
{{< /call-out >}}

{{< call-out "warning" "Warning" >}}
Currently, if you publish a package with a <code>rh6*</code> distribution tag, it will not be installable for Rhino 7. If your plug-in also works in Rhino 7, please mark it as compatible by copying the .yak file, updating the distribution tag part of the filename (i.e. <code>rh6_18</code> âž¡ <code>rh7_0</code>) and <a href="../pushing-a-package-to-the-server" class="alert-link">pushing both to the package server</a>.
{{< /call-out >}}

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
You might notice your plug-in's GUID lurking in the keywords. More information on how this is used can be found in the <a href="../package-restore-in-grasshopper" class="alert-link">"Package Restore in Grasshopper"</a> guide.
{{< /call-out >}}

Congratulations! ðŸ™Œ You've just created a package for your Grasshopper plug-in.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a package, [push it to the package server](../pushing-a-package-to-the-server) to make it available in the package manager!
