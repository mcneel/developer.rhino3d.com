## Package Structure

Packages are simply ZIP archives with a .yak extension. Take this simple example...

```
howler-0.4.0-any-any.yak
├── manifest.yml
├── Howler.rhp
├── Howler.rui
├── HowlerCommon.dll
├── HowlerGrasshopper.gha
└── misc/
    ├── README.md
    └── LICENSE.txt
```

### A note on .NET multi-targeting

From Rhino 8 onwards, Yak also supports multi-targeted applications so that your Rhino Plugin can be run in either dotnet core or dotnet framework.
Note that the `manifest.yml` must now be outside the framework directory, rather than inside of it.

```
howler-0.4.0-rh8-any.yak

```

## Requirements

1. Packages **must** have a `manifest.yml` file in the top-level directory. Details about the manifest can be found in the [Manifest Reference Guide](../the-package-manifest).
1. Any plug-ins (`.rhp`, `.gha`, `.ghpy` files) **must** be in the top-level directory, or a [multi-targeting directory](#a-note-on-net-multi-targeting), so that Rhino and Grasshopper can find and load them.
1. Package version numbers **must** either follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (e.g. `1.1.0-beta`) or `System.Version` a.k.a. Microsoft's four-digit standard (e.g. `1.2.3.4`). It's recommended to use Semantic Versioning because it allows package authors to specify prerelease versions. These are handy for limited testing, since by default the latest _stable_ version is installed.

## Distributions

For a single package version it's possible to upload multiple "distributions" to target different Rhino versions and platforms. This information is encoded in a "distribution tag" that is appended to the filename of the package, e.g. _example-1.0.0-rh7-win.yak_.

The distribution tag consists of an "app" identifier and version, and a platform. Currently the only supported apps are `rh` and `any` – Grasshopper ships with Rhino so it doesn't need its own identifier. Unless the app is `any`, an app version must be included in the form `<major>_<minor>`. The minor version is optional and is useful if a plug-in relies on an SDK change made in a service release. The platform can be `win`, `mac` or `any` (i.e. cross-platform).

A few examples...

* `rh7-win` - Rhino 7 for Windows >= 7.0
* `rh6_14-mac` - Rhino 6 for Mac >= 6.14
* `rh6_9-any` - Rhino 6 (both platforms) >= 6.9
* `any-any` - anything goes! (existing behaviour)

When installing packages, the package manager checks whether a compatible distribution exists for the requested version. Only package versions that have at least one compatible distribution will show up when the `_PackageManager` command is run in Rhino 7+.

The updated server works seamlessly with existing packages and old versions of Rhino. Pre-existing versions on the server (without distributions) will be treated as `any-any` when installing. New package versions that do not include a distribution tag, e.g. those created by previous versions of the CLI, will also be treated as `any-any` when publishing.

## Next Steps

Now that you've have seen what is in a package, why not create a package:

* [Create a Grasshopper package](../pushing-a-package-to-the-server) of your plugin.
* [Create a Rhino package](../pushing-a-package-to-the-server) for everyone.
* [Create a multi-targeted package](../creating-a-multi-targeted-rhino-plugin-package) for Rhino 8.
