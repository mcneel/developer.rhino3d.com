{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
Yak is cross-platform. The examples below are for Windows.
For Mac, replace the path to the Yak CLI tool with
<code>"/Applications/Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}.app/Contents/Resources/bin/yak"</code>.
{{< /call-out >}}



## Install

Installing a yak package with the CLI tool is simple.

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}\System\Yak.exe" install marmoset

Downloading marmoset (1.0.0)...
Downloaded marmoset (1.0.0)
Installing marmoset (1.0.0)...
Successfully installed marmoset (1.0.0)
```

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
Rhino will load new packages the next time it starts.
{{< /call-out >}}

You can also ask Yak to install a specific version.

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}\System\Yak.exe" install marmoset 1.0.0

...
```

The package is installed to a special folder, similar to the Grasshopper
Libraries folder but with a folder/file structure that Yak controls.


## Uninstall

Packages can also be easily uninstalled using the Yak CLI tool.

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}\System\Yak.exe" uninstall marmoset

marmoset successfully uninstalled
```

{{< call-out "note" "Note" >}}
Rhino will register that the package has been uninstalled
the next time it starts.
{{< /call-out >}}


## List

At any point you can check which packages are currently installed.

```commandline
> "C:\Program Files\Rhino {{< latest-rhino-version >}}\System\Yak.exe" list

marmoset (1.0.0)
```
