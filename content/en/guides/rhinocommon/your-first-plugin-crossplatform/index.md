{{< call-out bug "OBSOLETE" >}}
This guide is out of date and should not be used.
View the [Your First Plugin (Windows)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-windows) or [Your First Plugin (Mac)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-mac) guides, they are both cross-platform by default.
{{< /call-out >}}


It is presumed you already have *all* the necessary tools installed and are ready to go.  If you are not there yet, see both [Installing Tools (Windows)](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-windows) and [Installing Tools (Mac)](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-mac).  It is also helpful to have read and understood [Your First Plugin (Windows)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-windows) and [Your First Plugin (Mac)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-mac).

## Overview

There are many ways to architect a cross-platform solution, depending on your plugin, your projects, and your preferences.  In this guide we will employ a method called "cloned project files."  This method uses two very similar _.csproj_ files - each with platform-specific dependencies - that share the same source files.  The main goal is to illustrate a straightforward way of handling platform-specific needs while sharing the maximum amount of code.

We will build on what we learned in the HelloRhinoCommon sample projects seen in [Your First Plugin (Windows)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-windows) and [Your First Plugin (Mac)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-mac)...

## HelloRhino.CrossPlatform

Let's begin by creating a new solution to contain both platforms' projects.  For the sake of illustration, we'll begin on macOS in Visual Studio for Mac, but the reverse - on Windows in Visual Studio for Windows - should work.  It is useful to work in a folder that is visible to both macOS and Windows and/or use a version control system like git that can be used on both platforms.

### File New

1. If you have not done so already, *launch Visual Studio for Mac*.
1. Navigate to *File* > *New* > *Solution*...
![File New Solution](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-00.png)
1. A *New Project* wizard should appear.  In the left column, find the *Other* > *Miscellaneous* section.  Under Generic, select the *Blank Solution* template...
![New Solution](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-01.png)
1. Click the *Next* button.
1. You will now *Configure your new solution*.  For the purposes of this guide, we will name our solution *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform*.  Fill in the *Solution Name* field.  *Browse* and select a location for this plugin that is visible to both macOS and Windows.
![Solution Configuration](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-02.png)
1. Click the *Create* button.  *Note*: It is recommended that you create a .git repository for this demo.
1. A new *blank solution* called *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* should open.

### Add Project

#### Mac

1. As in the [Your First Plugin (Mac)](/guides/rhinocommon/your-first-plugin-mac) guide, let's add a template project to the solution.  Right-click the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* solution entry in the Solution panel.  Navigate to *Add* > *Add New Project...*.
![New Project](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-03.png)
1. A *New Project* wizard should appear.  In the left column, find the *Other* > *Miscellaneous* section.  Under General, select the RhinoCommon Plug-In template...
![New Project](/images/your-first-plugin-mac-02.png)
1. Click the *Next* button.
1. You will now *Configure your new project*.  Fill in the *Project Name* field...call it  *HelloRhino.Common*.  *Browse* and select the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* folder.  *Check* the *Create a project within the solution directory* checkbox; we want the *HelloRhino.Common.csproj* to be created in the *HelloRhino.Common* folder.
![New Mac Project](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-04.png)
1. In the Solution panel, *right-click* the *HelloRhino.Common* project and select *Rename*.  Rename the project *HelloRhino.Common.Mac*.
1. Rename *HelloRhino.CommonCommand.cs* to *HelloRhinoCommonCommand.cs*.
1. Rename *HelloRhino.CommonPlugin.cs* to *HelloRhinoCommonPlugin.cs*.
1. Open *HelloRhinoCommonPlugin.cs* and remove the period (`.`) between the `HelloRhino` and the `Common`:

```cs
public class HelloRhinoCommonPlugin : Rhino.PlugIns.PlugIn
  {  
    ///<summary>Gets the only instance of the HelloRhinoCommonPlugin plugin.</summary>
    public static HelloRhinoCommonPlugin Instance { get; private set; }

    public HelloRhinoCommonPlugin()
    {
      Instance = this;
    }
  }
```

### Clone Project

#### Windows

1. In Visual Studio for Windows, open the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* solution you created above.
1. You may get a warning about trusting this project.  Click *OK*.
1. Expand the *References* section of the *HelloRhino.Common.Mac* project.  Notice that Visual Studio for Windows cannot resolve the references to *RhinoCommon*, *Rhino.UI* and *Eto*.  This is to be expected, as this is not the Windows plugin project file.
![Bad References](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-05.png)
1. In the *Solution Explorer*, *right-click* the *HelloRhino.Common.Mac* project and select *Unload Project* from the drop-down menu.
![Unload Project](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-06.png)
1. In *Windows File Explorer*, navigate to the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform/HelloRhino.Common* folder.  We are going to *"clone"* (copy) the *HelloRhino.Common.Mac.csproj* as our template for the Windows *.csproj*.
1. *Copy* the *HelloRhino.Common.Mac.csproj* file and rename it *HelloRhino.Common.Windows.csproj*:
![Copy Project](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-07.png)
1. In Visual Studio for Windows, right-click on the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* solution in the Solution Explorer and navigate to *Add* > *Existing Project...*
![Add Existing Project](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-08.png)
1. Navigate to the *HelloRhino.Common.Windows.csproj* you just copied in Step 6 above.
1. In the Solution Explorer, expand the *References* section of *HelloRhino.Common.Windows* project.  Because we copied ("cloned") the *.csproj* file, these Mac-specific references are still present.  Let's delete those...
1. *Shift Select* the three references *Eto**, *Rhino.UI*, and *RhinoCommon* in the list.  *Right-click* and *Remove* those references.
![Remove Old References](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-09.png)
1. *Right-click* the *References* to *Add* new references.
1. Browse to *RhinoCommon.dll*.  (Let's presume we're targeting Rhino for Windows 64-bit).  The location of *RhinoCommon.dll* is *C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\RhinoCommon.dll*.  Click *OK*.
1. In the *Solution Explorer*, select the *RhinoCommon* reference you just added to *HelloRhino.Common.Windows*.  Open the *Properties* panel if it is not already visible (*View* > *Properties Window*).  Make sure *Copy Local* is *False*:
![Copy Local False](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-10.png)
1. In the *Solution Explorer*, *right-click* the *HelloRhino.Common.Windows* project and select *Properties* from the menu.
1. In the *Build Events* section, in the *Post-build event command line:* enter `Copy "$(TargetPath)" "$(TargetDir)$(ProjectName).rhp" Erase "$(TargetPath)"`...
![Build Events](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-11.png)
1. In the *Debug* section, in the *Start external program*, browse to: `C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5 (64-bit)\System\Rhino.exe`...
![Debug Properties](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-12.png)
1. *Build* and *Start Debugging*.  You should get two build errors concerning Eto.  Let's take this opportunity to do create some...

### Platform Defines

Though we are sharing cross-platform code, there will be inevitably be situations where you want to do one thing on Windows and another on Mac.  Within shared code, the way to manage this is with platform-specific defines in your platform-targeted projects.  Let's define a symbol to get around the reference errors we just encountered.

#### Windows

1. In the *Solution Explorer*, *right-click* the *HelloRhino.Common.Windows* project and select *Properties* from the menu.
1. In the *Build* section, switch the *Configuration:* to *All Configurations* and, in *Conditional compilation symbols*, create a define called `ON_RUNTIME_WIN`...
![Windows Define](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-13.png)
1. Open *HelloRhinoCommonCommand.cs*.
1. In the `using` section at the top, create a conditional define around the Eto references like this:

        #if ON_RUNTIME_APPLE
        using Eto.Drawing;
        using Eto.Forms;
        #endif
1. *Build* and *Start Debugging*.  Your build errors should disappear and debugging should begin.  You can use the PluginManager to install your plugin and the HelloRhino command should work.  When you are done testing out the command, stop the debugging session, close Visual Studio for Windows and switch back to...

#### Mac

1. In *Visual Studio for Mac*, open the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* solution (if it is not already open).
1. Notice that *HelloRhino.Common.Windows* is now present in your solution (as expected).  In the *Solution* panel, *right-click* the *HelloRhino.Common.Windows* project and select *Unload*...
![Unload Windows Project](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-14.png)
1. In the *Solution* panel, *double-click* the *HelloRhino.Common.Mac* project to bring up its *Project Options* (Properties).
1. Navigate to the *Build* > *Compiler* section in the *Project Options*.  Notice that the configuration is set to *Debug*.  In the *Define Symbols*: add a `ON_RUNTIME_APPLE` after `DEBUG`.  You must separate these with a semi-colon.  It should read: `DEBUG;ON_RUNTIME_APPLE`.  Switch the *Configuration* to *Release*.  Add the `ON_RUNTIME_APPLE` again (Visual Studio for Mac lacks an "All Configurations" like Visual Studio for Windows)...
![Add Mac Defines](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-15.png)
1. Click *OK* to close the *Project Options* dialog.
1. *Build* and *Run*.  The *HelloRhino* command from the plugin should autocomplete and run.

### Common Code

You have just created two platform-specific plugins using the same, shared code.  In review, let's take a look at the Solution architecture...simply open the *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* folder using either Finder or Windows File Explorer...

![Solution Architecture](/images/your-first-plugin-crossplatform-16.png)

In summary...

- The *HelloRhino.CrossPlatform* solution (*.sln*) contains the:
    - *HelloRhino.Common* folder, which contains the common code for the:
        - *HelloRhino.Common.Mac* project (*.csproj*) and the
        - *HelloRhino.Common.Windows* project (*.csproj*)

The cloned projects have platform-specific defines and platform-specific references, but otherwise reference the same shared (common) code.  Notice that the namespace of your common code is:

```cs
namespace HelloRhino.Common
```

This common (sometimes called "core") namespace can be thought of as a shared library.  This is where the "business logic" of your plugin should be stored.  

Even though it was possible - in this simple example - to share *all* of the code, in some real-life plugins, it may be necessary to separate out platform-specific projects that share the same Common core.

For example, you might want to structure a project this way:

- The *YourPlugin.CrossPlatform* solution (*.sln*) contains the:
    - *YourPlugin.Common* folder, which contains the common code for the:
        - *YourPlugin.Common.Mac* project (*.csproj*) and the
        - *YourPlugin.Common.Windows* project (*.csproj*), each of which reference:
            - *YourCommonBusinessLogic.cs* files in the *YourPlugin.Common* namespace.
    - *YourPlugin.Mac* folder, which contains the:
        - *YourPlugin.Mac* project (*.csproj*), which references *YourPlugin.Common.Mac*.
        - *YourMacSpecific.cs* files which do Mac-specific stuff.
    - *YourPlugin.Windows* folder, which contains the:
        - *YourPlugin.Windows* project (*.csproj*), which references **YourPlugin.Common.Windows*.
        - *YourWindowsSpecific.cs* files which do Windows-specific stuff.

This is merely one example; the architecture of the project depends on the needs of the plugin.  It is even possible to share much of the user interface code using Eto...but this is a subject for another guide.

*Congratulations!*  You have just built your first RhinoCommon plugin sharing common code between Rhino for Mac and Rhino for Windows.
