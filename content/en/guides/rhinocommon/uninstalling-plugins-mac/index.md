This guide presumes you have plugins installed that you would like to remove.

## Overview

Rhino for Mac does not (yet) have a Plugin Manager.  However, uninstalling plugins is very easy.  You simply remove the plugin folder from the *~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/MacPlugIns/* folder[^1] and then restart Rhino.

## Step-by-Step

1. *Quit Rhino*, if it is current running.
1. In *Finder*, navigate to the *~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/MacPlugIns/* folder.  If you [can't find this folder](#user-library), you can do the following...
   1. In the *Finder* toolbar, in the *Go* menu, select *Go to Folder...*

   1. In the *Go to Folder* dialog, paste the following path:
   *~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/MacPlugIns/*
![paste_path](/images/uninstalling-plugins-mac-02.png)
   1. Click *Go*.  A Finder window should open showing the contents of the folder.
1. *Remove* (move or delete) the plugin's folder from the *MacPlugIns* folder...

1. *Restart* Rhino.


## Behind the Scenes

When Rhino for Mac launches, it searches the contents of the:

*~/Library/Application Support/McNeel/Rhinoceros/MacPlugIns/*

folder scanning the sub-folders recursively looking for *.rhp* files.  When it finds such file, Rhino for Mac attempts to load this plugin.  If it cannot find a plugin, it will not load said plugin...it's *that* simple.


#### User Library

By default, the User Library folder is hidden from view.  

To make your Library visible in the Finder:

1. In *Finder*, navigate to your *Home* (*~*) folder.  You must be in your Home folder for this to work.
1. Press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> to bring up the *Finder View* options dialog...
![finder_view_options](/images/finder-view-options.png)
1. Check the *Show Library Folder* check box.  Now your Library should show up in the view.  You may want to drag this folder to your Favorites area of the Finder sidebar for easy access later.
