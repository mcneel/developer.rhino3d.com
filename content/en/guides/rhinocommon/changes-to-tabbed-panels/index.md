## Overview

Many Rhino controls are contained in tabbed, dockable panels. 

You can create tabbed panels in a plug-in using WinForms(Windows), WPF (Windows) or Eto (Windows and Mac).

You can find a sample that demonstrate how to create tabbed panels in the [Developer Samples repository](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples) on GitHub.

## Details

The tabbed panel systems work differently in Rhino 6 than it did in Rhino 5.

#### Rhino 5 for Windows Behavior

- The [registered](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/M_Rhino_UI_Panels_RegisterPanel.htm)  panel class must be a ```public``` class and contain a default constructor that takes no parameters.
- A panel instance is created the first time it is referenced by a visible host container and will survive for the length of a Rhino session.
- When a panel is moved to a different host container, the panels parent is changed to the new host and the same panel instance is used.

#### Rhino 6 for Windows Behavior (Per-Document Panels)

- The [registered](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/M_Rhino_UI_Panels_RegisterPanel_1.htm) panel class must be a ```public``` class and registered as a ```PanelType.PerDoc``` panel (the default [PanelType](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/T_Rhino_UI_PanelType.htm)).
- Rhino looks for public constructors in the following order:
  - Constructor taking a ```RhinoDoc```.
  - Constructor taking a ```uint``` representing the documents runtime serial number.
  - Constructor with no arguments.
- A panel instance is created each time a new document is created, if the panel is in a visible host container, and disposed of when the document closes.
- When a panel is moved to a different host container, the panels parent is changed to the new host and the same panel instance is used.

#### Rhino 6 for Windows Behavior (System Panels)

- The [registered](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/M_Rhino_UI_Panels_RegisterPanel_1.htm) panel class must be a ```public``` class and registered as a ```PanelType.System``` panel.
- Rhino looks for public constructors in the following order:
  - Constructor taking a ```RhinoDoc```.
  - Constructor taking a ```uint``` representing the documents runtime serial number.
  - Constructor with no arguments.
- A panel instance is created the first time it is referenced by a visible host container and will survive for the length of a Rhino session.
- When a panel is moved to a different host container, the panels parent is changed to the new host and the same panel instance is used.

#### Rhino 6 for Mac Behavior

Rhino for Mac works the same as Rhino for Windows, with the exception that there will be a panel instance per inspector panel that includes the plug-in panel.

## More Information

Rhino 6 includes a [IPanel](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/T_Rhino_UI_IPanel.htm) interface which can be implemented to determine when a panel is shown, hidden or closed.

Static events on ```RhinoDoc``` should be hooked by your panel class when created and unhooked when disposed of in both Rhino 5 and Rhino 6.
