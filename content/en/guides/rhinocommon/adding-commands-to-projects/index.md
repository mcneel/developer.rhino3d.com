## Problem

The RhinoCommon Project Wizard ([Windows](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-windows/#rhinocommon-templates) or [Mac](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-mac/#install-the-rhino-add-in)) creates a skeleton plugin project with a single command.  However, plugins can contain more than one command.  How does one add additional commands to plugin projects?

## Solution

To add a new command to your RhinoCommon plugin project, you simply need to define a new class that inherits from `Rhino.Commands.Command`.

An easy way to do this is to just use the *Empty RhinoCommmon Command* template. Here is how you do that:

1. Make sure you have the RhinoCommon Project Wizard ([Windows](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-windows/#rhinocommon-templates) or [Mac](/guides/rhinocommon/installing-tools-mac/#install-the-rhino-add-in)) installed.
1. Launch *Visual Studio* and open your plugin project.
1. From *Visual Studio*, navigate to *Project* > *Add New Item* menu item.  From *Visual Studio for Mac*, right-click on the project name in the *Solution Explorer* and navigate to *Add* > *New File...*.
1. Select the *Empty RhinoCommmon Command* template from the list of installed templates.
1. Provide a unique file name that relates to the command you are adding.
1. In *Visual Studio for Windows*, click the *Add* button.  In *Visual Studio for Mac*, click the *New* button.
