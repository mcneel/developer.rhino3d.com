## Description

-   `id` (_readonly_) - A **lowercase** GUID that uniquely describes each product. This GUID must be unique in the entire system.
-   `creationDate` (_readonly_) - A unix timestamp in seconds representing the date the product was added to Cloud Zoo. 
-  ` iss` (_readonly_) - The id of the issuer as registered with Cloud Zoo.
-   `format` - A [License Format object](/guides/rhinocommon/cloudzoo/cloudzoo-licenseformat). Cloud Zoo will send all requests to add a license to the system to the issuer of the product whose license format matches the given license key.
-   `version` - The version of the product that this license represents. This string is user facing and will be used in Rhino as well as in the Licenses Portal.
- `platforms` - An array of supported platforms for this license. Currently, only `Windows` and `Mac` are supported.
- `picture`  - A url where an icon for this product may be found. The icon must not be larger than 1MP.
- `downloadUrl`  - A url where the actual software the product represents may be downloaded. This link will be publicly available to users.
-   `titles` - A dictionary of localized product names. Each key represents an ISO 639-1 language code. You may specify a two letter country code after the language with a dash or an underscore (i.e. such as `zh-tw`, case insensitive). If that exact language id is not available for a particular task in the system, the system will attempt to use a more generic language id (i.e. for example, if `es-CO` is not available, then the system will try to use `es`). If the region agnostic language id is also not available, en (English) will be used. At least one key-value pair must be present, preferably in English.
