In Cloud Zoo, an _issuer_ represents a vendor of products with license keys. If you want your plugin to use Cloud Zoo, you must register to be an issuer by emailing support@mcneel.com with the subject _"Cloud Zoo issuer registration for NAME"_ (replace _NAME_ with your name\*) or clicking on the link below.

<br/>

{{< mailto
    email="support@mcneel.com"
    subject="Cloud Zoo issuer registration for NAME"
    body="Please register a new Cloud Zoo issuer for 'NAME' to use with the following plug-in(s): ..."
    class="btn btn-primary btn-czreg"
    >}}Send us a registration email{{</ mailto >}}

<br/>
<br/>

\* _Please provide the name (organization or individual) that you would like the issuer to be registered under, e.g. "Acme Inc" or "Jolyn Bloggs"._

You will be provided with an issuer id and a secret that will uniquely identify you as a product vendor and will allow you to implement the required HTTPS callbacks.
