## Creating the Virtual Machine

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up a virtual machine using Azure services. 

To start, please confirm that you have a valid Azure subscription and that you have already setup a resource group to hold the various resources for this instance. To learn more about setting up a resource group on Azure, [visit this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).

1. Sign in to the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).

1. Type **virutal machines** in the search bar.

1. Under **Services**, select **Virtual machines**.

1. In the **Virtual machines** page, select **Create** then **Virtual Machine**

1. In the **Basics** tab, under **Project details**, make sure the correct Subscription and Resource group are selected.

1. Under **Instance details**, create a unique name for the virutal machine. We'll use *Rhino-Compute-VM* for our VM name. Select a region close to you, and then select *Windows Server 2022 Datacenter - Azure Edition Gen2* for the **Image**. Feel free to select any **Size** VM that fits your needs. We'll use *Standard DS2_v2* for this example. Leave the other defaults.

1. Under **Administrator account**, provide a username and a password. Take note of these credentials as we will use these when we log into the remote machine.

1. Under **Inbound port rules**, choose **Allow selected ports** then select **RDP (3389)**, **HTTPS (443)**, and **HTTP (80)**.

1. Select **Next : Disk >**.

1. Select **Next : Networking >**.

1. Under the **Network interface** section, click on the *Create new* button under the **Public IP** subsection.

1. When the pop-out blade opens up, select **Static** under the Assignment tab. Click **OK** to save this setting.

1. Leave all other defaults. Select **Review + create**.

1. Once your configuration passes the validation check, select **Create** to deploy your virtual machine.

1. After deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**.

### Add an inbound port rule

Once your virtual machine has been deployed you should be able to go to the resource home page. Here, you can change various settings and configurations. We are going to add an inbound port rule so that we can send API requests on a dedicated port.

By default, Azure denies and blocks all public inbound traffic - which also includes ICMP traffic. This is a good thing since it improves security by reducing the attack surface. The [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) is typically used for diagnostics and to troubleshoot networking issues. 

We'll want to turn ICMP traffic on for our VM so that we can try to ping the IP address and make sure we get a response. The first thing we need to do is add an inbound port rule for ICMP traffic. 

1. On the left-hand side menu, select the **Networking** menu item. This will open the Networking blade.

1. Click on the **Add inbound port rule** button

1. In the **Add inbound security rule** pane, set the **Destination port ranges** to *, change the **Protocol** to **ICMP**, set the **Priority** to **100**, and type **ICMP** in the **Name** input.

1. Click **Add** to create the new inbound port rule.

Congratulations! In this guide, you deployed a simple virtual machine on Azure.
