## Problem

ActiveX controls placed in a simple dialog box will crash Rhino.

## Solution

ActiveX, or OLE, controls work in Rhino plugins, as C/C++ plugin are simply regular MFC DLLs.  For more information on MFC DLLs, read [MFC Technical Note 33](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hw85e4bb(v=VS.80).aspx) and [MFC Technical Note 58](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ft1t4bbc(v=VS.80).aspx) for more information.

Also, you will need to call this function:

```cpp
void AfxEnableControlContainer();
```

in your `CWinApp`-derived object's `InitInstance()` member to enable support for containment of OLE controls.
