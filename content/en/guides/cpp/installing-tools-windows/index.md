By the end of this guide, you should have all the tools installed necessary for authoring, building, and debugging C/C++ plugins using the Rhino C/C++ SDK on Windows.

## Prerequisites

This guide presumes you have:

### Rhino 8

- A PC running Microsoft Windows 10 or later.
- [Rhino 8 for Windows](https://www.rhino3d.com/download).

### Rhino 7

- A PC running Microsoft Windows 8.1 or later.
- [Rhino 7 for Windows](https://www.rhino3d.com/download).

## Install Visual Studio

### Rhino 8

To write C++ plugins for Rhino 8 using the Rhino 8 C/C++ SDK, you will need a version of Microsoft Visual Studio that includes the Visual Studio 2019 (v142) platform toolset. Thus, you can use either [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/).

1. Download **Microsoft Visual Studio**, either [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/).
2. Run the **Visual Studio installer** you just downloaded.

3. Follow the onscreen prompts to install Visual Studio.
4. Check the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
5. Click the **Individual components** tab.
6. Scroll to the **Compilers, build tools, and runtimes** section and check the following option:
    1. MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
7. Scroll to the **SDKs, libraries, and frameworks** section and check the following options:
    1. C++ v14.2 ATL for v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
    2. C++ v14.2 MFC for v142 build tools (x86 & x64)
    3. Windows 10 SDK
8. Check any additional features required for your project.
9. When finished, click **Install**.
10. Depending on your internet connection, this can take several minutes to complete.

If you already have Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or 2019 installed, then you will want to re-run the **Visual Studio Installer** and verify you have all the the components installed.

### Rhino 7

To write C++ plugins for Rhino 7 using the Rhino 7 C/C++ SDK, you will need [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/).

1. Download **[Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)**.
2. Run the **Visual Studio installer** you just downloaded.

3. Follow the onscreen prompts to install Visual Studio.
4. Check the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
5. Click the **Individual components** tab.
6. Scroll to the **SDKs, libraries, and frameworks** section and check the following option:
    1. Visual Studio SDK
7. Check any additional features required for your project.
8. When finished, click **Install**.
9. Depending on your internet connection, this can take several minutes to complete.

If you already have Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 installed, then you will want to re-run the **Visual Studio Installer** and verify you have all the the components installed.

## Install the Rhino C/C++ SDK

The **Rhino C/C++ SDK** is a set of tools for creating plugin using the C++ language. The SDK includes headers, libraries and Visual Studio project wizards to get you started creating plugins quickly.

### Rhino 8

1. Exit **Visual Studio**.
2. Download the **[Rhino 8 C/C++ SDK](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-sdk/8/latest/)**.
3. Run the **SDK installer** you downloaded.
4. Download the **[Rhino Visual Studio Extension (VSIX)](https://github.com/mcneel/RhinoVisualStudioExtensions/releases)**.
5. Run the **VSIX installer** you downloaded.
6. If the installation is successful, run Visual Studio.

### Rhino 7

1. Exit **Visual Studio**.
2. Download the **[Rhino 7 C/C++ SDK](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/Rhino-SDK/7.0/latest)**.
3. Run the **SDK installer** you downloaded.
4. If the installation is successful, run Visual Studio.

## Next Steps

**Congratulations!** You have the tools to build a C/C++ plugin for Rhino for Windows. *Now what?*

Check out the [Creating your first C/C++ plugin for Rhino](/guides/cpp/your-first-plugin-windows/) guide for instructions building your first plugin.
