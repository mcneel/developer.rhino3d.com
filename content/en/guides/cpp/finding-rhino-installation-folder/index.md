## Problem

You are putting together an installer for your Rhino plugin. You would like to know how you can, programatically, get Rhino's installation folder.

## Solution

### Rhino 8, 7, and 6

If you are looking for Rhino 8, 7, or 6, then you can find the location of Rhino's installation folder by looking in the Windows Registry in this location:

```text
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\<version>\Install
Name:  InstallPath
Type:  REG_SZ
```

If you are looking for Rhino 8, for example, replace `<version>` with `8.0`.

### Rhino 5

If you are looking for Rhino 5 64-bit, then you can find the location of Rhino's installation folder by looking in the Windows Registry in this location:

```text
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0x64\Install
Name:  InstallPath
Type:  REG_SZ
```

If you are looking for Rhino 5 32-bit, then you can find the location of Rhino's installation folder by looking in the Windows Registry in this location:

```text
Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Key:   SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Install
Name:  InstallPath
Type:  REG_SZ
```
