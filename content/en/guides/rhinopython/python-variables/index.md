## Overview

A variable is a convenient placeholder that refers to a computer memory location where you can store program information that may change during the time your script is running.  For example, you might create a variable called ClickCount to store the number of times a user performs a certain operation.  
When a variable is stored in memory, the interpreter will allocate a certain amount of space for each variable type.  Where the variable is stored in computer memory is unimportant.  What is important is that you know that a variable has a type, and you refer to a variable by name to see or change its value.  

In Python, variables are always one of the five fundamental data types:

* [Numbers](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/#numbers)
* [String](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/#string)
* [List](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/#list)
* [Tuple](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/#tuple)
* [Dictionary](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/#dictionary)

For a detailed look at each variable type see [Python Variable Types](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/) in this guide.

While each variable has its own properties and methods, there are common methods we use to deal with all variables in Python.

## Declaration

In Python, variables are created the first time a value is assigned to them.  For example:

```python
number = 10
string = "This is a string"
```

You declare multiple variables by separating each variable name with a comma.  For example:

```python
a, b = True, False
```

This is the same the multiple line declaration of:

```python
a = True
b = False
```

## Naming Restrictions

Variable names follow the standard rules for naming anything in Python.  A variable name:

- Must begin with an alphabetic character (A -Z) or an underscore (\_).
- Cannot contain a period(.), @, $, or %.
- Must be unique in the scope in which it is declared.
- Python is case sensitive.  So "selection" and " Selection" are two different variables.

Best practices for all Python naming can be found in the (Style Guide for Python Naming Conventions)[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions]

## Scope & Lifetime

Scope of a variable defines where that variable can be accessed in your code.  For instance a `global` variable can be accessed from anywhere in your code.  A `local` variable can only be accessed within the function it was declared in.  Generally a variable's scope is determined by where you declare it.  

When you declare a variable within a procedure, only code within that procedure can access or change the value of that variable.  It has local scope and is a procedure-level variable.  If you declare a variable outside a procedure, you make it recognizable to all the procedures in your script.  This is a global variable, and it has global scope.

Here are few examples:

```python
global_var = True

def function1():
    local_var = False
    print (global_var)
    print (local_var)

function1() # this runs the function
print (global_var) # this works because global_var is accessible
print (local_var)  # this gives an error because we are outside function1
```

It is important to be careful when declaring variables.  It is easy to create duplicate variable names that do not reference the correct values.  For instance do not declare a global variable this way:

```python
g_var = 'True'
def function2():
    g_var = 'False'
    print ('inside the function var is ', g_var)

print ('outside the function var is ', g_var)
```
The example above will create a `Global` variable named `g_var`.  When dropping in the `function2` function, there will be a second `local` variable created named `g_var` with a different value. The proper way to work with a global variable is to be very explicit with the `global` statement in the `local` scope:

```python
g_var = "Global"
def function2():
    g_var = "Local"
    print ('inside the function var is ', g_var)
    return;

function2()
print ('outside the function var is ', g_var)
```

For more scope example see the (Notes on Python Variables)[http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/01/python-variable-scope-notes/]

The lifetime of a variable depends on how long it exists.  The lifetime of a `global` variable extends from the time it is declared until the time the script is finished running. At procedure level, a variable exists only as long as you are in the procedure.  When the procedure exits, the variable is destroyed.  Local variables are ideal as temporary storage space when a procedure is executing.  You can have local variables of the same name in several different procedures because each is recognized only by the procedure in which it is declared.

## Assigning Values

Values are assigned to variables creating an expression as follows: the variable is on the left side of the expression and the value you want to assign to the variable is on the right.  For example:

```python
B = 200
```

The same value can be assigned to multiple variables at the same time:

```python
a = b = c = 1
```

And multiple variables can be assigned different values on a single line:

```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, "john"
```

This is the same as:

```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = "john"
```

## Scalar Variables & Lists

Much of the time, you only want to assign a single value to a variable you have declared. A variable containing a single value is a scalar variable.  Other times, it is convenient to assign more than one related value to a single variable.  Then you can create a variable that can contain a series of values. This is called an list variable. List variables and scalar variables are declared in the same way, except that the declaration of an array variable uses brackets `[ ]` following the variable name.

```python
A = [ ] # This is a blank list variable
B = [1, 23, 45, 67] # this list creates an initial list of 4 numbers.
C = [2, 4, 'john'] # lists can contain different variable types.
```

For a detailed look at managing lists, take a look at the the [Python List Datatype Article](/guides/rhinopython/python-datatypes/#list)
