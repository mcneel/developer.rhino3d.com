## Point  & Vector Methods

The following methods are available for creating and manipulating 3-D points and 3-D vectors.  3-D points and 3-D vectors are represented as  zero-based, one-dimensional arrays that contain three numbers. For more information, see the [Points](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-points) and [Vectors](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-vectors) discussion in [RhinoScript Fundamentals](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-introduction).

| Method | | |  Description |
|:--------|:-:|:-:|:--------|
| IsVectorParallelTo | | | Compares two vectors to see if they are parallel.  |
| IsVectorPerpendicularTo | | | Compares two vectors to see if they are perpendicular.  |
| IsVectorTiny | | | Verifies a vector is tiny.  |
| IsVectorZero | | | Verifies a vector is zero. |
| PointAdd | | | Adds a point or a vector to a point. |
| PointArrayBoundingBox | | | Returns the bounding box of an array of 3-D points. |
| PointArrayClosestPoint | | | Finds the point in an array of 3-D points that is closest to a test point |
| PointArrayTransform | | | Transforms an array of 3-D points.|
| PointClosestObject | | | Finds the object that is closest to a test point.|
| PointCompare | | | Compares two points.|
| PointDivide | | | Divides a point by a value.|
| PointsAreCoplanar | | | Verifies that a list of 3-D points are coplanar.|
| PointScale | | | Scales a point by a value.|
| PointSubtract | | | Subtracts a point or a vector from a point.|
| PointTransform | | | Transforms a point.|
| ProjectPointToMesh | | | Projects one or more points onto one or more meshes.|
| ProjectPointToSurface | | | Projects one or more points onto one or more surfaces |
| PullPoints | | | Pulls points to a surface or a mesh object.|
| VectorAdd | | | Adds two vectors.|
| VectorAngle | | | Returns the angle between two 3-D vectors.|
| VectorCompare | | | Compares two vectors.|
| VectorCreate | | | Create a vector from two 3-D points.|
| VectorCrossProduct | | | Returns the cross product of two vectors.|
| VectorDivide | | | Divides a vector.|
| VectorDotProduct | | | Returns the dot product of two vectors.|
| VectorLength | | | Returns the length of a vector.|
| VectorMultiply | | | Multiplies two vectors.|
| VectorReverse | | | Reverses a vector. |
| VectorRotate | | | Rotates a vector. |
| VectorScale | | | Scales a vector. |
