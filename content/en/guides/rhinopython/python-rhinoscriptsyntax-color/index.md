## Colors

Colors in Rhino are represented as  zero-based, one-dimensional arrays that contain four values.  The first 3 values are the Red, Green and Blue channels.  Each channel may contain a value from 0 to 255.  The fourth value is the Alpha Channel.  This control transparency of the color.  0 is completely transparent and the default value of 255 is completely opaque. 

```
color contains (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)
```

Use the `CreateColor()` function to create a new color structure:

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

color1 = rs.CreateColor(128, 128, 128) # Creates a medium grey color.
```

The `CreateColor()` function assumes the alpha value is 255 by default. 

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

col = rs.CreateColor(43,45,56)

print (col.R)
print (col.G)
print (col.B)
```

Unlike many other Rhino types, colors are immutable.  This means you cannot set one channel by itself, but must always create a new color when trying to make a color.  Setting one channel will not work, for instance `color1.B = 56` will throw an error. 

Here is a table of commonly used colors:

| Color       |      |  Red |      | Green |      | Blue |
| ----------- | ---- | ---: | ---- | ----: | ---- | ---: |
| Black       |      |    0 |      |     0 |      |    0 |
| White       |      |  255 |      |   255 |      |  255 |
| Medium Gray |      |  128 |      |   128 |      |  128 |
| Aqua        |      |    0 |      |   128 |      |  128 |
| Navy Blue   |      |    0 |      |     0 |      |  128 |
| Green       |      |    0 |      |   255 |      |    0 |
| Orange      |      |  255 |      |   165 |      |    0 |
| Yellow      |      |  255 |      |   255 |      |    0 |
