## Planes

Planes are represented by a [Plane](/api/RhinoCommon/html/T_Rhino_Geometry_Plane.htm) structure.  Planes  can be thought of as a zero-based, one-dimensional list containing four elements: the plane's origin ([point3D](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-points)), the plane's X axis direction ([vector3d](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-vectors)), the plane's Y axis direction ([vector3d](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-vectors)), and the plane's Z axis direction ([vector3d](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-vectors)).

plane contains (pointOrigin, vectorX, vectorY, vectorZ)
```

It is easy to forget that there is a specific geometric relationship between the axes.  With Planes, the Y axis is automatically oriented 90-degrees to the X axis.  The X axis is the only axis that can be easily defined.  The Y axis is made orthogonal to the X vector, and the direction of the Z axis is computed from the cross-product of the other two vectors.

Planes can be constructed in a number of ways. One common function is `PlaneFromPoints`:

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

plane = rs.PlaneFromPoints((-2,-5,0),(1,2,0),(-3,3,0))

print(plane.Origin) # origin point
print(plane.XAxis) # x-axis vector
print(plane.YAxis) # y-axis vector
```

Plane also have a number of properties that can be used to get or set the individual values in the Point object.  In the example below the `.Origin`, `.XAxis`, `.Yaxis`, `.Zaxis` are used.

Planes can also be created using the `CreatePlane()`, [PlaneFromFrame](/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/win/#collapse-PlaneFromFrame),  [PlaneFromNormal](/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/win/#collapse-PlaneFromNormal), and [PlaneFromPoints](/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/win/#collapse-PlaneFromPoints) functions.

To change origin of a Plane, simply assign a new value to the `.Origin` property.

```python
import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs

plane = rs.PlaneFromPoints((-2,-5,0),(1,2,0),(-3,3,0))

print(plane.Origin) # origin point
print(plane.XAxis) # x-axis vector
print(plane.YAxis) # y-axis vector

plane.Origin = rs.CreatePoint(3,4,5) # Changes the origin of the plane.

print(plane.Origin)
print(plane.XAxis) # x-axis vector
print(plane.YAxis) # y-axis vector
```

RhinoScriptSyntax contains a number of functions to manipulate planes.  See [Lines and Planes](/guides/rhinopython/python-rhinoscriptsyntax-line-plane-methods) for details.

Also, please see the Python primer [Section 8.5 Planes](/guides/rhinopython/primer-101/8-geometry/#85-planes).
